/*Descrição:
Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: a, b, and margin. The function should return whether a is lower than, close to, or higher than b. a is "close to" b if margin is higher than or equal to the difference between a and b.

When a is lower than b, return -1.

When a is higher than b, return 1.

When a is close to b, return 0.

If margin is not given, treat it as zero.

Example: if a = 3, b = 5 and the margin = 3, since a and b are no more than 3 apart, close_compare should return 0. Otherwise, if instead margin = 0, a is lower than b and close_compare should return -1.

Assume: margin >= 0

Tip: Some languages have a way to make arguments optional.
